A personal project to help me organize tasks on for my 3-days sprint workflow.
This was made under the challenge of not using any frameworks at all. No jQuery or bootstrap, just pure Javascript, HTML5, and CSS

Not the most user friendly webapp, but it bets the job done. [Demo](http://www.tux.madart.tech/okitoki)

Not mobile-friendly, best viewed in computer or tablet in landscape mode.
